/*"var" is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared with "var" have a function-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they were declared*/
/*
"let" have the block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they were declared */

/*"const"  is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. This makes "const" variables useful for declaring constants, such as pi or the gravitational constant,*/

/*"let", "const" variables have the block-level scope, and, they are not accessible before they are declared.*/
